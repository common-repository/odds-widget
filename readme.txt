Add a fully customisable odds widget to your website/blog that displays odds from the leading bookmakers. The widgets can be added straight into pages/posts or as a WordPress Widget.

== Description ==

** This plugin is no longer supported.**

The Odds Widget plugin allows webmasters to create widgets for their website that display the latest football odds (more sports coming very soon). The widgets load lightning fast and allow visitors to get the very best odds.

By adding your own affiliate links in the bookmakers section you can earn commission when a new user registers on the bookies website. We offer a generous 80/20 split, therefore 80% of all clicks are attributed to you.

With dozens of configuration and layout options it's easy to create a widget with the same style as your website.

== Installation ==
1. Install the Odds Widget plugin by either visiting the WordPress.org plugin directory or by uploading the 'odds-widget' folder to the '/wp-content/plugins/' directory on your server/host.
2. Go to the 'Plugins' menu and click 'Activate'.
3. Click on the 'Odds Widget' menu and choose 'Settings'.
4. Generate your API key by clicking the button and click 'Save'.
5. Start creating your widgets and add them to your website/blog.

== Frequently Asked Questions ==
I would like some help with the plugin, who can I contact? Unfortunately we no longer support the plugin, sorry.

I can't find the sport I'm looking for, what can I do? Currently only football (soccer) is supported.
